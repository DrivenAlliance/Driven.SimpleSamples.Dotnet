These samples use the 'NUNit' testing framework, version 2.5. This is done 
by referencing the nunit.framework.dll assembly. For further reading on NUnit, 
see http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=quickStart&r=2.4

======================================================
NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from  JUnit, the current 
production release, version 2.5, is the sixth major release of this xUnit based unit testing tool 
for Microsoft .NET. It is written entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage 
of many .NET language features, for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. 
NUnit brings xUnit to all .NET languages.
