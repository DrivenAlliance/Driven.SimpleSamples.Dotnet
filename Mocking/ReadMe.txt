These samples use the 'Rhino Mocks' mocking framework, version 3.5. This is done 
by referencing the Rhino.Mocks.dll assembly. For further reading on Rhino Mocks,

======================================================
A mock object is generally used as a stand-in, or replacement, for a real object while the 
system is being unit tested. The main purpose of using a mock object is to allow our tests 
to be more focused, self contained, predictable and reliable. By having our unit tests more 
isolated and predictable we can identify the cause of the failure in less time and false 
negatives (tests which fail but should pass) are reduced.
